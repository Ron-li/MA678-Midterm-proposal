- Abstract
 As house price is related to every one of us, itâ€™s especially important to understand what
factors may influence it. We developed a linear regression model to assess how these house features correlate with house price. Our model results found that many of these variables did have a effect on price. Adjusting the method for measurement may be a necessary step forward for effectively
assessing price.  

- Data
Data was downloaded on github and cleaned using stringr package in R. The final dataset included 21613 house transactions across Seattle from 2014-2015.
